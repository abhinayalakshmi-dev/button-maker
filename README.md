ðŸš€ Just Launched: Button Maker â€“ A Simple Way to Build Custom Buttons 

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
I recently built a little tool called Button Maker â€“ and I think a few of you might find it useful.

Weâ€™ve all been there: tweaking padding,  fiddling with border-radius valuesâ€¦ just to make one button look right. ðŸ˜…
So I thought â€” why not create a tool that lets you design buttons visually and gives you the clean code right away?

What it does:
ðŸ”˜ Lets you customize your buttonâ€™s text, colors, border,, easy-to-use interface.
âš¡ Shows a live preview as you tweak things.
ðŸ§¾ Exports the HTML & CSS with one click â€” ready to copy and paste into your project.


Why I made it:
This started as a fun side project, but it quickly turned into something genuinely helpful for speeding up frontend work.
Whether you're a beginner who doesnâ€™t want to wrestle with CSS yet, or a dev who just wants a fast workflow â€“ this might save you a few headaches.
